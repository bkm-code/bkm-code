- 👋 Hi, I’m @bkm-code
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End Development, and mildly curious about Back End programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently following the freecodecamp.org curriculum; learning Javascript, React-Redux & Typescript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Javascript. I'm open to learning new technologies.
